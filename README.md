# BigBasket's-discounting-dynamics

BigBasket's journey reflects a strategic evolution in its business model. It started with a "purchase-to-order" approach and later transformed into an 'inventory model,' directly sourcing from suppliers and the 'hyper-local model' ensures one-hour neighbourhood deliveries, and collaboration with over 20k+ farmers guarantees fresh produce at lower prices. By directly dealing with major manufacturers like P&G and HUL, they secure volume discounts, passing the benefits to us with no added costs.

# Revenue Model
BigBasket relies on a small margin added before selling, heavily leaning on private labels like Fresho and BB Royal for sustainability.

# Analyzing discounts across categories, BigBasket employs varied strategies
On average, BigBasket is offering:
Highest Discount: "Kitchen, Garden & Pets" (22%) and "Fruits & Vegetables" (21%). Higher competition, no added costs/middlemen, or products with a shorter shelf life may influence these significant discounts.
Lowest Discount: Baby Care (6%) & Snacks & Branded Foods (7%). Indicates a premium position or brand loyalty, allowing them to maintain prices without the need for significant discounts.
